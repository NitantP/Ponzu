# Ponzu

Ponzu is my homemade meal prep buddy. After taking on the task of cooking at home for the college year, I realized I would need to stay
organized to make the process easier. Ponzu serves to catalog items in my pantry and to curate a shopping list for me. The shopping list
can check to see what I already have in my pantry so that I can more efficiently do my grocery shopping. With Ponzu's pantry system,
you can keep track of what items you have, when you bought them, when they expire, and how much you have left. Ponzu is a lightweight
CLI tool that relies on storing information about pantries and shopping lists in JSON files. Ponzu is still a growing project with
many features to add, some of which include connecting to my smartphone to transfer information easily to bring with me on the go.
This is just a personal project, but if you find a use for it, please let me know! I'd love to hear your thoughts.
